# React + Internationalization (without packages)

## Motivation

Something that I have seen throughout my career is that many developers are extremely lazy or have little time to do their tasks and for that reason their first solution to everything is to install NPM packages even for the simplest things.

For that reason I decided to make this project, a fairly simple web page and using React's Context API and the hooks I made a simple implementation of what would be react-i18n.

It is NOT a perfect implementation but it is pretty good for a version 0.0.1
